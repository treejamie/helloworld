# Python Hello, World!

The nice thing about python is that you can jump straight in and start writing code. There's no real project structure and it's mostly up to the user and readme to get setup. The bad thing about python is that you can jump straight in and start writing code.

## Installation

Instructions for installing:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone git@github.com:treejamie/helloworld.git

# Navigate into the directory
cd helloworld/python
```
## Features

This app will say hello in six different languages

1. English
2. Greek
3. Gaelic
4. Hebrew
5. Macedonian
6. French

These languages were picked purely to play with different character sets.Attempts were made to see if I could use the [ISO639-1 code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes) to spell `he`, `ll`, `ow`, `or`, `ld`. But that didn't work out.

```bash
# run the hello world for a random greeting
python hello.py

# run the hello world for a target language
python hello.py [en|el|gd|mk|he|fr]

# run the tests
python -m unittest discover
```
There's a bonus feature if you open the the file in a python shell and call `greeting` with a non-supported language code. This requires `ipython`, which is detailed in the [development](#development) section.

```bash
ipython
from hello import greeting
greeting('lol')
'HELLO, WORLD!'  # Magic shouty English translation powers (fallback for unsupported languages)
quit
```

## Development

I've been using [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) because I'm a dastardly rogue who likes unconventional tools. `uv` is a Python toolchain manager, similar to `pip` but with extra features, but some folks raise concern over the fact it is the product of a commercial entity.


```bash
# make a virtualenv
uv venv .python

# activate
source .python/bin/activate

# install requirements
uv pip install -r requirements.txt

# fire up ipython (a decent Python REPL, though not quite IEx)
ipython

# and do this for autoreload goodness and great benefit
%load_ext autoreload
%autoreload 2

```
