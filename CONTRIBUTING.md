It is important to me that the code in main is written by own fair hands. After all, the point of the repository is so that I can demonstrate personal competance over a range of languages.

Where solutions are offered via pull requests they'll live in that branch. I warmly accept solutions from the general population but do understand that should they be merged, then they'll live in a contrib branch.

If you want to point out improvements to the code in `main`, then please feel free to do so.
