# üëã Hello World üåç

Most programming languages have a "Hello World" as their first introductory example.  I thought it would be nice to have a repo dedicated to just "Hello World" examples.

It should also give you an idea of the languages that I'm into and my understanding of them.

## Rules

1. Each example should be the most minimal "project" imaginable. Printing out text isn't the aim here. The aim here is to understand how to start a project in that language.

2. Each example should have tests to ensure the output is correct.

3. Have a bit of fun.


## Completed

* Elixir
* Python (needs tests)
* Rust (needs tests)
* Go (needs tests)

## LLM / AI

My usage of AI is inline with my personal AI policy. I don't have this written down at the time of writing, but in short it is this.

1. I won't use AI output if I don't understand it. I should be capable of writing it.
2. I Never use AI to kick the learning can down the road. My relationship to AI is like that of a professor and a student. I ask it questions and I ask it to judge my work, but I never expect it to do my work.
3. I am honest about my useage of AI and understand the implications of lying about it.
4. I am able to work without it; but give me time to read so I can summarise and sythesise.
